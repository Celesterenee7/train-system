# Train System
#### Ruby Database Basics
#### By Celeste Renee Morton
## Description:
The goal for this two day project is to make a program that maps a train system. It should allow train system operators to add, update and delete information. It should allow train riders to read information regarding when and where they can ride a train.
Trains will stop in a number of cities and each city may have a number of trains coming through it.

## User Stories:
* As a train system operator, I want to create, read, update, delete and list trains, so that I can track all of the trains in my system.
* As a train system operator, I want to create, read, update, delete and list cities where my trains will stop, so that I can manage where all of the trains will go.
* As a train rider, I want to view a train, so that I can see the cities where it stops.
* As a train rider, I want to view a city, so that I can see which trains come to it.
* As a train rider, I want to see a timetable that shows what time each train stops in each city.
* As a train rider, I want to purchase a ticket in a particular city for a particular train so that I can get on and off in any city that train travels. (This can work like a MAX ticket where you are able to purchase the ticket independent of the destination).
